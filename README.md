# InvestED
## Inspiration:

Investing can be a daunting task for those who are unfamiliar with technical financial terminology and analysis. InvestED was built to act as a support for those who are new to investing.

## What it does:

InvestED allows for users to follow a selection process that explains their choices when analyzing a stock to invest in a simplified and easy-to-understand manner. 

## How we built it:

We took data from Goldman Sachs USCANFPP, sourced from the Marquee API, and stored it within a SQL database to simplify stock analysis. The user interface was developed using UIkit framework.

## Challenges we ran into:

As a group of relatively new hackers, our inexperience often lended itself to slowing down our full stack solution. For example, we had to learn how to utilize SQL databases with no prior experience, as well as struggling through the API documentation of Marquee which frequently left us puzzled.

## Accomplishments we are proud of:

While on one end standing as challenges, conquering these obstacles left us with an unparalleled sense of pride. Spending several hours fiddling with data only for it finally appear in our SQL3db browser might not be immensely impressive, we learned tremendously from it.
